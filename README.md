# Muse's NLTK Cookbook

[NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) is a powreful tool for natural language processing in Python. There are a lot of really great resources on the internet discussing the features of NLTK at length. This will not be one of those. Instead, this cookbook aims to share some common algorithms that you can get started playing with right away. By using the Jupyter/iPython notebook format, you can read each step and execute code as you go, getting immediate feedback. 

Please share any questions/additions on [the github repo](http://github.com/nelsonam/muses-nltk-cookbook/issues) or reach out to me on Twitter [@musegarden](http://twitter.com/musegarden).
